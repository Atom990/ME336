# Week 15 Final Presentation

It seems the COVID-19 has caused far more troubles than we expected. It forces us to make new (unwanted) changes to the final presentation. After discussing with the teaching team, I decide to make the following changes to this semester's final presentation (assignment). For the final assignment, each student is asked to reproduce one of the tasks from [the 100 tasks on RLBench Gitub Page](https://github.com/stepjam/RLBench), explain detailed steps on your reproduction process, and write an academic review of this particular manipulation task for robot learning from literature in a 6-page full paper using this template. Besides this paper, you also need to organize your code in a zip file and prepare a (10-min) PowerPoint presentation to be submitted before the Thursday (May 28) noon at this [link](https://jinshuju.net/f/wsq98y).

Further details on preparing this assignment can be found [here](overleafCode/A_Template_for_ME336_Final_Paper.pdf). A zip file of the source code can be downloaded [here](overleafCode.zip).

Good Luck!
