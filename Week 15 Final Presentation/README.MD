# Week 15 Final Presentation

It seems the COVID-19 has caused far more trouble than expected, and it forces us to make new changes to the final presentation. After discussing with the teaching team, I decide to make the following changes to this semester's final presentation (assignment).

- The students will be asked to form four teams, with 2 students per team. Please let us know members of your team as soon as possible and get started with the final assignment.
- Each team will need to submit your final code, paper, and video before the Thursday noon of Week 15.
- If any of your team members has access to GPU resources, then your final assignment will be to train a trash sorting classifier using the content we've provided. You will need to write a 6-page paper explaining how you designed/implemented a learning algorithm to train the classifier, and present your design and results in the video presentation.
- If neither of your team members has access to GPU resources, then your final assignment will be to design a data collection experiment for a robot manipulation task and explain why you designed this experiment, what you've done to conduct this data collection, how you ensure the collected data to have a high-quality for later training and generalization for implementation. You will need to summarize your assignment into a 6-page paper, with a video presentation and the related code.


Good Luck!
